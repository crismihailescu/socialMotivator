# socialMotivator

Our project is an event management platform for increasing social engagement in local communities. It allows companies and charities to add events like beach cleanups or soup kitchen volunteering, and users can quickly and easily sign up alone or in a group. Companies can also add prizes they want to offer that are randomly gifted to participants for that event. 

Our project is a social-good motivation platform. It entails:
- Having companies volunteer social initiatives as prizes
- People competing by doing good deeds to unlock those social initiatives
- Having leaderboards and teams, and a mix of small and big acts of service

		Who is it for?
			Companies/Charities/Governments that want to promote social good, and people who care about making a social impact in their community (and winning prizes)
		What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
			Help people serve their community/charities without solely donating, but by taking action
		What type of data will it store?
			Activities posted by companies, charities, or local government. User Information. 
		What will users be able to do with this data?
			Companies can see how many many people are participating and use it for publicity and users will be able to do activities to earn some cash/incentives.
		What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
			Points/leaderboards
			Location from around the world
			Integrations with charities like the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup, etc.
